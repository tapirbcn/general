Motorized Glass Cabinet
=========

We picked up from the street a glass cabinet, we want to turn it into a cool
motorized cabinet that will only open when we approach an NFC tag.

Requirements
----

  - It will open only when the right NFC tags are close
  - It will spin
  - It will have glow in the dark swag

How are we going to wire things up
-----------

We need one motor to make it spin (the cabinet is quite heavy, we will require a
powerful motor). Also 4 servos to open lock/unlock the doors.

For the security system we will start with a keypad, later on we will add
nfc.
