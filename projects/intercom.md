Intercom hack
=========

The idea is simple, we want to understand how our door intercom works to be able to:

  - Open the door form our phones and laptops.
  - Listen/Talk from our phones and laptops.
  - Make it "ring" since it appears broken.

What we know
----

We know it is an intercom using an ***Analogic*** system called 4+N, similar one to ours is 
the Golmar T-810.

We also know how to open the dor (it is just adding continuity to two wires), so that is
something we could already do.


How we will wire things up
-----------

It is yet to be decided, we want the intercom to connect to the network so perhaps we do the
usual arduino + raspberry pi.
